Access to water and sanitation is a fundamental human right and sets the foundation of socio-economic development as well as food and energy production, healthy ecosystems and national security. Water is vital for human survival. 

In the wake of globalization, a growing population, and shifting climates, water supply obstacles are increasing. SWIM is dedicated to helping overcome these obstacles through optimized and problem-oriented water management approaches and prevention of potential conflicts between stakeholders or nation-states.
