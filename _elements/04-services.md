Our services are appropriate for both cases, before the conflict arises and in the cases of existing conflicts. 

We believe that tensions over water resources, despite changing environmental and socio-economic boundary conditions, can be a driver for cooperation rather than conflict. Moreover, SWIM seeks to identify and implement approaches for water conflict prevention to warrant regional and national security as well as the safe implementation of the SDGs.

In short, we work to support: 

- Safe access to clean water and sanitation as human right
- National and regional stability and security 
- Cooperation and peace between conflicting actors  
- Water poverty reduction 
- Increase in water use efficiency
