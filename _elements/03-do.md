Water challenges are characterized by complex interdependencies. We recognize that effective solutions are beyond the scope of a single discipline or area of research. Therefore, we integrate knowledge and approaches from many disciplines, involve actors that have a stake in the process, and identify feasible long-term solutions. 

SWIM offers a variety of services ranging from interdisciplinary research, strategic policy analysis, advice and consulting in international, national and regional water governance, water management and water policy. SWIM has a strong focus on the interdisciplinary connection of technical, spatial geographical data with social science, politics and demographics.

Our expert analysts and researchers engage directly with all actors on the field, share multiple perspectives and propose sustainable policy solutions. 

We work with policymakers, civil society, academic institutions and conflict actors to transform water related conflicts and therefore promote the realisation of all human rights and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 

Further, we publish comprehensive reports and precise analysis to facilitate decision-making and raise awareness for overlooked aspects which threaten water security and peace.  

SWIM has a strong focus on the interdisciplinary connection of technical, spatial geographical data with social science, politics and demographics. The consideration of both aspects allows SWIM to identify best-practice approaches such as adaptation measures for uncertain variabilities before they occur and thus help to prevent conflicts.  

In addition, a key value of SWIM are its partners and its network. SWIM cooperates closely with individuals of academic institutions, non-governmental organisations and consultancies. For more information, please refer to our “Partners” section.
