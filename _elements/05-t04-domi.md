Dominique has a background in Environmental and Resources Management and is currently pursuing her Master's degree in Hydro Science and Engineering at the Technical University Dresden. She has experiences in inter-transdiciplinary project and research work in both, national and international organizations, always focusing on Water Resources and Land-Use Management by using stakeholder involvement as a key component. Living temporarily in countries with predominating water shortages and uprising conflicts, her interests are now prioritized in finding solution options to combat the primary sources for those, and to turn her gained knowledge into practice.
