We believe water management is conflict management. By 2025, we seek to become an established institution for the prevention of water related conflict issues through quality in-depth research and long-term situation analysis on water management approaches. We aim to develop into a leading institution which consults water sector actors on measures to form resilient and sustainable water management and utilization schemes on all scales of implementation.
