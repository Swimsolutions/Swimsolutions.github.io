SWIM works for a world in which every person has unconditional, conflict-free access to water and sanitation.

As a result, we seek to develop into a leading institution that consults water sector actors in decision-making processes to form conflict resilient, effective, and sustainable water management and utilization schemes on all scales of implementation.
